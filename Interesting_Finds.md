# Interesting Results/Resources : 

• The dataset used to validate the classification method and signal processing for brain–computer interfaces was obtained from the BCI competition (Tabar and Halici, 2016; Amin et al., 2019b; Dai et al., 2019; Olivas-Padilla and Chacon-Murguia, 2019; Qiao and Bi, 2019; Roy et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019; Tayeb et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019; Li Y. et al., 2020; Miao et al., 2020; Polat and Özerdem, 2020; Rammy et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2021, 2022; Tiwari et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). This dataset comprises EEG data obtained from participants. Class 1 was the left hand, Class 2 was the dominant hand, Class 3 was both feet, and Class 4 was the tongue in the cue-based BCI structure. For each subject, two workouts were captured on interspersing time frames. Each session consisted of six runs separated by relatively short pauses. A phase includes 288 efforts, with each effort being implemented 48 times.

• DEAP dataset (Koelstra et al., 2011) includes 32 individuals who saw 1-min long music video snippets and judged arousal/valence/like–dislike/dominance/familiarity, as well as the frontal facial recording of 22 out of 32 subjects (Chen et al., 2019b; Ozdemir et al., 2019; Wilaiprasitporn et al., 2019; Aldayel et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020a; Liu J. et al., 2020).

• SEED dataset wherein EEG was documented over 62 streams from 15 participants as they regarded short videos eliciting positive, negative, or neutral feelings (Gao et al., 2020a; Hwang et al., 2020; Liu J. et al., 2020).

• One participant observes an arbitrary picture (chosen from 14k pictures in the ImageNet ILSVRC2013 training dataset) for 3 s, while their EEG signals are documented. Over 70,000 specimens are also included (Fares et al., 2019).
